    description: "This is my bf's mom's favorite Italian restaurant. She loves it so much that she randomly buys us takeout salad from there because apparently we don't eat enough vegetables. This review is solely based on the to go Italian Salad! And it was delicious. First, it is a good size. For only $6 you get a bunch of Romaine Lettuce, Peppers, Salami, Prosciutto, Olives, Cheese, Tomatoes and a good portion of dressing. Tbh, that gets them the 5th star because they aren't skimpy with dressing. I like my salad to not taste like salad.",
