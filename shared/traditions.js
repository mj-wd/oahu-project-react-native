        description: "Luau is one of Hawaii's best known celebration. It's a traditional Hawaii banquet paired with the typical garlands of flower -lei- moving at the rythm of Hula. It's really recurrent and doesn't just belong to one day. It may be for a baptism, a birthday or a wedding. But it's not a Luau if there aren't leism tropical fruit, ukelele music and Hula dancing!",

        description: "\"May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii Nei.\" This popular phrase in the islands prevents anyone from forgetting this special day. It was Don Blanding, a writer and poet, who first suggested that a holiday should be dedicated to the beautiful Hawaiian tradition of making and wearing lei. But it was Grace Tower Warren, also a writer, who came up with the idea that the holiday should coincide with May Day. And so since the first Lei Day on May 1, 1928, Hawaii has continued the annual celebration to this very day.",
