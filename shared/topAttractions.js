        description: "The towering North Shore waves start here in Waimea Bay.  The winter swells that roll into the famous Oahu North Shore beaches, generally top out at Waimea Beach Park , on the right hand side of the bay. Surfing the Bay, along with Sunset Beach and the Banzai Pipeline, is considered almost a pilgrimage among many pro-surfers that fly in from all around the world to partake in the daring action. The fun generally begins when the National Weather Service issues high surf warnings for the North Shore.  Waimea Beach Park is located just past Haleiwa Beach, and across from Waimea Falls Park",

        description: "This is my bf's mom's favorite Italian restaurant. She loves it so much that she randomly buys us takeout salad from there because apparently we don't eat enough vegetables. This review is solely based on the to go Italian Salad! And it was delicious. First, it is a good size. For only $6 you get a bunch of Romaine Lettuce, Peppers, Salami, Prosciutto, Olives, Cheese, Tomatoes and a good portion of dressing. Tbh, that gets them the 5th star because they aren't skimpy with dressing. I like my salad to not taste like salad.",

        description: "Since the annual Merrie Monarch competitions began in the early 1960’s, the terms hula kahiko (ancient dances) and hula auana (literally wandering dances; the term refers to hula which has “wandered” from its ancient rituals and roots, i.e. dances accompanied by instruments and incorporating ideas introduced after contact with Europeans began in 1778) have come into common use.  These originated as categories for competitors, but have become so popular that they have affected modern hula teaching and performance.",

        description: "Fifteen minutes past Hanauma Bay and beyond Sandy Beach (another popular local beach) you’ll find the large parking lot that leads to the 2-mile paved trail overlooking the lighthouse. Renovations were recently made to the lighthouse and the trail was recently repaved and additional lookout points were added. This moderately easy hike pays off with breathtaking views of the indigo ocean and Oahu’s eastern, or Windward Coast. You can even see the island of Molokai in the distance. Two other smaller islands, Manana (the larger of the two, also known as Rabbit Island) and Kaohikaipu are also visible just offshore.",
