        description: "The towering North Shore waves start here in Waimea Bay. The winter swells that roll into the famous Oahu North Shore beaches, generally top out at Waimea Beach Park , on the right hand side of the bay. Surfing the Bay, along with Sunset Beach and the Banzai Pipeline, is considered almost a pilgrimage among many pro-surfers that fly in from all around the world to partake in the daring action. The fun generally begins when the National Weather Service issues high surf warnings for the North Shore. Waimea Beach Park is located just past Haleiwa Beach, and across from Waimea Falls Park",

        description: "This little treasure has plenty of soft sand and seclusion for a morning of peaceful, relaxing or swimming. Lanikai Beach used to be about a mile long, but the development of seawalls has caused erosion, making it about a half-mile. But certainly a gorgeous half mile! Lanikai has been ranked many times among the best beaches in the world. Two lovely offshore islands, soft white sand, and azure blue waters make it the idyllic tropical postcard spot.",

        description: "Situated on the historic North Shore of Oahu, Sunset Beach is a beautifully long expanse of beach that has enamored both locals and tourists for decades. During the summer, the blindingly blue ocean waters are calm and crystal-clear, making it the perfect destination for swimmers, snorkelers and families. But as the winter months roll in, so do the large waves, making conditions suitable only for the most experienced of surfers. Surf fans are still welcome to watch pros ride these giants from the safety of the shoreline and take photos of this awe-inspiring natural phenomenon.",
